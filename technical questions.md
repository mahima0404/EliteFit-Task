### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

**Framework and Language Choice:**  
For this application, JavaScript (ES2022) was chosen for its compatibility with frameworks like React. JavaScriptâ€™s latest features provide enhanced usability and development efficiency.

**Useful Feature in JavaScript ES2022: `at()` Method**  
The `at()` method, introduced in ES2022, allows easy access to elements in arrays and strings, with support for negative indices. This enables direct access to the last element of an array without calculating the length.

**Code Example Using `at()` Method:**

const tasks = ["task1", "task2", "task3"];
console.log(tasks.at(-1));  // Output: "task3"

### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Tracking down a performance issue in production involves a multi-step process that includes monitoring, analysis, and testing. Here's an approach I typically use:

#### Monitor and Identify the Problem Area
- **Logs and Error Tracking**:  
  Check error logs across the application, server, and database for recurring issues.
- **Metrics and Monitoring**:  
  Use APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Dynatrace) to monitor high-latency requests and CPU/memory usage. Alerts and dashboards can help pinpoint issues.
- **User Feedback**:  
  Collect feedback and bug reports from users, which may reveal performance issues first.

#### Analyze and Narrow Down
- **Profiling**:  
  Use tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js Profiler for CPU/memory-bound issues. Database profiling can highlight slow queries.
- **Database Queries**:  
  Check for inefficient queries by examining slow query logs and identifying unindexed columns.
- **Tracing**:  
  In microservices, use tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger, AWS X-Ray) to follow requests across services and identify bottlenecks.

#### Replication and Testing
- **Staging Environment**:  
  Attempt to replicate the issue in a staging environment using load simulation tools (e.g., Apache JMeter, Gatling).
- **Code Review**:  
  Inspect code for redundant computations, unnecessary network calls, and memory-heavy operations.

#### Fix and Deploy
- **Optimizations**:  
  Based on the findings, apply fixes like caching, optimizing queries, and reducing code complexity.
- **Testing and Monitoring Post-Fix**:  
  After deployment, monitor the app for improvements and stability, using load testing to verify performance under high traffic.

### 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

Some features I would consider adding include:

#### 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- **User Accounts**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own tasks.
- **Role-based Access**: Implement roles (e.g., admin, regular user) to control access to specific features.

#### 2. Collaborative Task Management
- **Shared Tasks**: Enable users to assign tasks to other team members for collaborative work.
- **Comments and Activity Log**: Allow users to comment on tasks and track changes for better team communication and accountability.

#### 3. Enhanced Notifications and Reminders
- **Email and Push Notifications**: Notify users about upcoming deadlines, overdue tasks, or any priority updates.
- **Recurring Tasks**: Allow users to set tasks that repeat on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

#### 4. Advanced Filtering and Sorting
- **Custom Filters**: Let users save specific filters (e.g., "High Priority & Due This Week") for quick access to relevant tasks.
- **Sorting by Multiple Criteria**: Enable sorting tasks by priority, due date, tags, labels, or assignees for better organization.

#### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- **Task Insights**: Provide users with statistics on task completion, overdue tasks, and priority distribution.
- **Progress Visualization**: Use charts or graphs to display task completion trends over time, helping users visualize their progress.
