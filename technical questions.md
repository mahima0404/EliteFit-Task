1.How long did you spend on the coding test? 
Ans.The time spend on this coding test is 24 hours.
2.What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
Ans Framework and Language Choice
For such an application, many developers would choose JavaScript with frameworks like React or Vue.js for the front end and Node.js or Python/Django for the back end. I'll use JavaScript (ES2022) to highlight a feature in the latest ECMAScript standard.

Useful Feature in JavaScript ES2022: at() Method
The JavaScript at() method, introduced in ES2022, allows for easy access to elements in arrays and strings. Notably, it supports negative indices, which is helpful for accessing elements from the end of an array without having to calculate the length.

3.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Ans.Tracking down a performance issue in production is a multi-step process that combines monitoring, analysis, and often iterative testing. Here’s a typical approach I’d use, along with tools and techniques for each stage:
1. Monitor and Identify the Problem Area
Logs and Error Tracking: Check error logs to see if there are any recurring errors or warnings. This includes application logs, server logs, and database logs.
Metrics and Monitoring: Use APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Dynatrace to identify high-latency requests, high CPU or memory usage, or other abnormal metrics. Dashboards and alerts in these tools are helpful to spot the general area where issues may occur.
User Feedback: Sometimes performance issues are first noticed by users, so reviewing recent feedback or bug reports can point to specific areas of the app that are slow or problematic.
2. Analyze and Narrow Down
Profiling: For CPU or memory-bound issues, use profilers to inspect the application's runtime behavior. For example, Chrome DevTools or Lighthouse can help profile front-end issues, while Node.js Profiler or Python’s cProfile might be used on the back end.
Database Queries: Performance bottlenecks often relate to inefficient database queries. Using a database monitoring tool or simply examining the slow query log (for SQL databases) can highlight queries that are taking longer than expected. Look for unindexed columns or frequent queries within a short time.
Tracing: Distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or AWS X-Ray are invaluable in microservice architectures. They allow you to trace requests across services to pinpoint which service is causing latency.
3. Replication and Testing
Staging Environment: If possible, replicate the problem in a staging environment. Try to mirror production traffic or use synthetic testing with tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling to simulate load and verify the issue.
Code Review: Sometimes, performance issues can be spotted through code inspection. Look for patterns like redundant computations, unnecessary network calls, or memory-intensive operations.
4. Fix and Deploy
Optimizations: Once identified, the fix might include adding caching, optimizing database queries, updating code to reduce complexity, or introducing load balancing or additional resources if needed.
Testing and Monitoring Post-Fix: After deploying the fix, monitor the application to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues were introduced. Load tests are helpful here to simulate high-traffic scenarios and observe performance stability.

4.If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
Ans.1. User Authentication and Authorization
User Accounts: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own tasks.
Role-based Access: Implement roles (e.g., admin, regular user) to control access to specific features.
2. Collaborative Task Management
Shared Tasks: Enable users to assign tasks to others, making it easier for teams to collaborate on projects.
Comments and Activity Log: Add a commenting feature within each task, allowing team members to discuss progress or updates. An activity log could also track changes for better accountability.
3. Enhanced Notifications and Reminders
Email and Push Notifications: Notify users of upcoming deadlines, overdue tasks, or priority changes.
Recurring Tasks: Allow users to set tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
4. Advanced Filtering and Sorting
Custom Filters: Let users save specific filters (e.g., “High Priority & Due This Week”) to quickly access tasks that match their preferences.
Sorting by Multiple Criteria: Allow sorting tasks not only by priority or due date but also by custom criteria like tags, labels, or assignees.
5. Analytics Dashboard
Task Insights: Show statistics on completed vs. overdue tasks, task completion times, and priority distribution, giving users insights into their productivity and workload.
Progress Visualization: Add charts or graphs to visualize task completion over time, helping users track their performance and stay motivated.
